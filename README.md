# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Way to go so far, but there are still some work to be done:

- The different sections is not fully styled according to the design file.
  *There are some broken images in the buttons
  *The buttons should be styled accordingly and also have a hoover effect.
  \*The animations (arrow and banner) are missing.

Keep up the energy 👍🏼
